# Utils

The Utils package provides a set of utilities and helper functions that are used throughout the Boost framework. This package contains general-purpose implementations that simplify common tasks and promote code reuse.

## Overview

Utils offers solutions for recurring problems in application development, such as collection manipulation, generic interfaces, and string processing. These implementations follow best practices and are optimized for performance and security.

## Main Components

### Collections

The `collections` subpackage provides structures and functions for working with data collections, such as lists, maps, and sets. It includes efficient implementations for common collection operations, such as filtering, mapping, and reduction.

These implementations are designed to be generic and reusable, allowing developers to work with collections of different types in a consistent and efficient manner.

### Interfaces

The `interfaces` subpackage defines generic interfaces that are used throughout the Boost framework. These interfaces establish clear contracts between components and promote code decoupling and testability.

The interfaces defined in this package are carefully designed to be simple, cohesive, and extensible, following the principles of effective interface design.

### Strings

The `strings` subpackage offers functions for string manipulation and processing. It includes implementations for common operations such as formatting, validation, transformation, and string analysis.

These functions are optimized for performance and security, and follow best practices for string handling in Go, including considerations for internationalization and character encoding.

## How to Use

To use the Utils package in your application:

1. Import the specific subpackage that contains the desired functions or structures
2. Use the functions or structures in your code as needed
3. Combine different utilities to solve complex problems

## Integration with Other Packages

Utils is used by virtually all other components of the Boost framework:

- Bootstrap: For helper functions during initialization
- Factory: For collection manipulation and interfaces
- Wrapper: For string processing and data manipulation
- Model: For implementing common behaviors

## Extensibility

The Utils package was designed to be easily extensible. To add new utilities:

1. Identify the appropriate subpackage or create a new one if necessary
2. Implement the functions or structures following existing patterns
3. Add appropriate tests and documentation

## Contribution

Contributions to the Utils package are welcome. When contributing, make sure to follow the code standards and add appropriate tests for new functionalities.

# Model

The Model package defines the fundamental data structures and interfaces used throughout the Boost framework. This package serves as the foundation for data representation and behaviors across the entire application.

## Overview

Model provides definitions of types, interfaces, and structures that are shared between different components of the framework. It establishes a common vocabulary and ensures consistency in data handling throughout the system.

## Main Components

### Errors

The `errors` subpackage provides a standardized structure for error handling in the Boost framework. It includes:

- Custom error types for different scenarios
- Functions for creating and manipulating errors
- Utilities for formatting and presenting errors

This component allows for consistent and informative error handling throughout the application.

### RestResponse

The `restresponse` subpackage defines structures for standardizing responses in REST APIs. It includes:

- Models for success and error responses
- Utilities for response formatting
- Functions for conversion between different formats

This component ensures consistency in API interfaces and facilitates integration with external clients.

## How to Use

To use the Model package in your application:

1. Import the package or specific subpackage containing the desired structures
2. Use the defined interfaces and structures in your code
3. Extend the base structures when necessary for specific cases

## Integration with Other Packages

Model integrates with virtually all other components of the Boost framework:

- Bootstrap: For defining initialization structures
- Factory: For defining factory interfaces
- Wrapper: For defining adapter interfaces
- Extra: For defining middleware and health check structures

## Extensibility

The Model package was designed to be easily extensible. To add new structures or interfaces:

1. Identify the appropriate subpackage or create a new one if necessary
2. Define the new structures or interfaces following existing patterns
3. Add appropriate documentation for the new definitions

## Contribution

Contributions to the Model package are welcome. When contributing, make sure to follow the code standards and add appropriate tests for new functionalities.

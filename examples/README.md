# Examples

The Examples package provides reference implementations and practical demonstrations of how to use the various components of the Boost framework. This package serves as executable documentation and a starting point for developers who want to learn how to use the framework.

## Overview

Examples contains complete applications and code snippets that illustrate usage patterns, best practices, and common use cases for the Boost framework. These examples are designed to be clear, concise, and educational, easing the learning curve for new users.

## Main Components

### Boot

The `boot` subpackage demonstrates how to initialize applications using the Boost framework. It includes examples of:

- Basic application configuration
- Component initialization
- Integration of different modules
- Application lifecycle management

These examples serve as a starting point for developers who want to create new applications with the Boost framework, illustrating the recommended patterns for project structuring and initialization.

## How to Use

The examples are designed to be executed directly, allowing developers to experience the framework's behavior firsthand. To use the examples:

1. Navigate to the directory of the specific example you want to explore
2. Read the source code and comments to understand the purpose and structure of the example
3. Execute the example following the provided instructions
4. Try modifying the example to explore different configurations and behaviors

## Integration with Other Packages

The examples demonstrate the integration between various components of the Boost framework:

- Bootstrap: For application initialization
- Factory: For creating component instances
- Wrapper: For using adapters to external libraries
- Extra: For additional functionalities like middleware and health checks

## Contribution

Contributions to the Examples package are especially welcome, as quality examples are essential for the adoption and effective use of the framework. When contributing:

1. Make sure the example is clear and focuses on a specific aspect of the framework
2. Include detailed comments explaining the purpose and functioning of the code
3. Provide clear instructions on how to run and experiment with the example
4. Consider adding variations that demonstrate different configurations or use cases

Well-documented and educational examples are a valuable way to contribute to the Boost ecosystem, helping new users understand and effectively use the framework.
